## Arc V: Paradise Lost

*The unintended consequences of smart product adoption: how convenience becomes surveillance, features become dependencies, and innovation creates new forms of inequality. This arc examines the security, privacy, and social challenges that emerge when products become platforms, and explores approaches for building smart tangibles that enhance human agency rather than diminishing it.*

- Chapter 19: Smart AND Secured? Think Again
- Chapter 20: Smart Product Cyber Threat Mitigation
- Chapter 21: Societal Threats

Arc IV positioned smart products for market success. This part confronts the darker side of that success: what happens when millions of connected devices create attack surfaces, surveillance infrastructure, and new social inequalities that their creators never intended.

Chapter 19 maps the threat landscape — the attack vectors, vulnerabilities, and systemic risks that smart products introduce by design. Chapter 20 shifts to mitigation — the engineering practices, regulatory frameworks, and organizational disciplines that reduce cyber risk across a product's lifetime. Chapter 21 widens the lens beyond security to examine societal consequences: privacy erosion, digital divides, planned obsolescence, and the ethical responsibilities that come with building products that observe, learn, and act in people's lives. Together, these chapters argue that security and social responsibility are not afterthoughts but architectural decisions that must be made alongside the infrastructure choices of Arc II.
