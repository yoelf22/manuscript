### Chapter 21 - Societal Threats



#### What's Not To Be Done?

##### Out in the Open

Governments declare and conduct policies, along with international governing bodies, standards organizations - to protect their citizens from cyber security threats. These actions may start in legislation, regulatory actions, international cooperation.

On the other hand, governments have been known in the past to use regulation as a non-tariff-barrier in order to impede entry or rapid expansion of foreign companies, protect domestic manufacturing.

An outstanding example to this practice is the US ban on Huawei, the Chinese telecommunication giant:

In May 2019, the U.S. added Huawei to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List, barring American firms from doing business with it without a license. This followed the 2019 NDAA, which had already banned federal use of Huawei gear over national security concerns tied to the company’s links to the Chinese government.

The FCC later banned Huawei equipment sales, citing security risks. These actions disrupted Huawei’s global operations, cut revenues, and pushed it to develop alternatives to U.S. technology. U.S. pressure also led allied nations to reassess Huawei’s role in their critical infrastructure.

(You can read more about the impact on Huawei business in [<u><span>Wired article</span></u>](https://www.wired.com/story/huawei-says-us-sanctions-reduce-revenue-dollar30-billion/) from June '17)

While the official rationale emphasized national security, many analysts highlight protectionist motives. Huawei’s leadership in 5G challenged U.S. tech dominance, especially given the lack of a domestic telecom giant.

The ban aligned with broader efforts to decouple from Chinese supply chains and stimulate domestic tech investment. Outlets like [_<u><span>The Economist</span></u>_](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/05/16/trade-can-no-longer-anchor-americas-relationship-with-china) _<u><span>(Here too)</span></u>_, [_<u><span>Brookings</span></u>_](https://www.cfr.org/report/securing-5g-networks), and [_<u><span>CSIS</span></u>_](https://www.cfr.org/report/securing-5g-networks) view the policy as both strategic and economically motivated.

An even more recent the ban on Chinese electric vehicle use in government agencies in the UK was cast In 2025 by the UK government implementing measures restricting the presence of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) at sensitive military sites.

Reports indicated that staff at facilities like RAF Wyton were instructed to park such vehicles at a distance from key buildings due to cybersecurity concerns. The Ministry of Defence’s directive was based on fears that embedded technology in these EVs could be exploited for espionage, potentially compromising sensitive data.

While not a blanket ban, this policy reflects the UK’s cautious approach to foreign technology in critical areas. The move aligns with broader efforts to safeguard national security amidst increasing integration of connected technologies in everyday assets.

##### In the Shadows

While governments publicly champion the protection of citizens and businesses from espionage, they frequently employ similar tactics themselves - typically under the banner of national security. Yet in some cases, these actions extend to surveilling political rivals, activists, and journalists, often without clear justification or judicial oversight, revealing a troubling use of power beyond legitimate defense.

Governments have repeatedly engaged in covert surveillance of their own citizens, targeting journalists, activists, and political opponents. In [<u><span>Hungary</span></u>](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/19/hungarian-journalists-targeted-with-spyware-in-government-backed-attacks), Pegasus spyware was used to monitor investigative reporters and critics of the regime.

In [<u><span>Italy</span></u>](https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-prosecutors-investigate-intelligence-agency-over-illegal-spying-allegations/), intelligence officials were investigated for unlawfully surveilling judges and journalists tied to anti-corruption and mafia cases. In the U.S., the [<u><span>NSA’s mass surveillance</span></u>](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order) programs, exposed by Edward Snowden, revealed widespread, warrantless data collection.

Germany’s [<u><span>BND</span></u>](https://www.dw.com/en/german-intelligence-agency-spied-on-journalists-worldwide/a-19079783) also spied on domestic and foreign reporters. These cases show how democratic governments, citing security, often bypass oversight to suppress dissent.

##### **Security Product Leadership**

What can - and should - product leaders do about these tendencies?...  

Product leaders occupy a critical junction between innovation, user experience, and responsibility. As smart products become vectors for surveillance - whether by governments, third parties, or internal misuse - leaders must take an active stance in defending user trust and civil liberties.

1.  **Design with abuse scenarios in mind**

Anticipate not only technical failure, but **intentional misuse** of features (e.g., always-on microphones, location sharing). Ask: **_What happens if this is used against the user?_**

2.  **Push for transparency and control**

Ensure clear communication around data collection, storage, and sharing. Give users **genuine control** - not just buried toggles or legalese.

3.  **Advocate for secure, privacy-respecting defaults**

Don’t wait for regulators. Enforce **end-to-end encryption**, disable unnecessary telemetry, and avoid dark patterns that coerce consent.

4.  **Challenge questionable business requirements**

Push back when leadership or clients demand functionality that compromises user agency. Align product integrity with **long-term brand trust**.

5.  **Lead internally by example**

Foster a culture where security, ethics, and **user respect are non-negotiable**. Collaborate with legal, privacy, and engineering teams early in the roadmap.

**_Are you too considering security and privacy of your connected product users?..._**
