Arc III showed how to validate before committing capital. This part turns to the market-facing question: once you have a validated, infrastructure-rich smart product, how do you position it so customers understand — and pay for — its value?

First impressions determine whether a smart product earns the chance to demonstrate its deeper capabilities. Killer features define the single compelling reason a customer switches from what they already own. And the Swatch case study examines what happens when a legacy brand confronts a platform-powered competitor head-on — and whether style, heritage, and manufacturing scale can substitute for an ecosystem moat. Together, these chapters provide frameworks for translating technological capability into market perception and competitive positioning.
