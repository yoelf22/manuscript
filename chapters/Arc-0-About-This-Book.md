### What Are Smart Tangibles?

Smart tangibles are physical products enhanced by digital capabilities that push them far beyond their original hardware boundaries. They evolve from static objects into adaptive systems – products that learn, update, and grow more valuable over time through software, cloud services, and integrations with broader ecosystems.

Unlike traditional hardware that delivers fixed value at purchase, smart tangibles create ongoing relationships with users. They blend physical functionality with digital interfaces, upgradeable firmware, and data-driven features that create a comprehensive user centered platforms, unlocking new business models – from subscriptions to usage-based services.

This shift builds customer loyalty and competitive moats that pure hardware cannot match. The "smart" designation isn't about sensors alone; it's about turning simplistic purchase transactions into long term relationships, enabling hardware to participate in ever-evolving, defensible business systems.

### Why This Book?

***Smart Tangibles [how to build hardware your customers won't leave and your competitors can't copy]*** addresses the defining challenge hardware makers face: **how to achieve long lasting product-market-fit in the hardware industry – and how to build sustainable competitive advantage.**

As hardware industries face shrinking margins, rising user expectations, and relentless competition from low-cost manufacturing, executives grapple with a defining question: How can physical product leaders harness software to create lasting customer value, build defensibility, and generate recurring revenue?

Traditional hardware development has always carried high failure risk - long cycles, capital intensity, and validation challenges that software largely avoids. Yet as software continues "eating the world," it creates unprecedented opportunities to embed intelligence, adaptability, and continuous service into physical products.

***Smart Tangibles*** provides a strategic framework and practical playbook for hardware visionaries – and their teams – to navigate this transformation and succeed where others fail. In some ways, it adapts and extends the principles of Marty Cagan’s ***Inspired*** and Eric Ries’s ***Lean Startup*** into the rapidly evolving domain of smart, connected hardware.

### Book Overview

The underlying premise in ***Smart Tangibles*** is that physical products must acquire digital capabilities to create compelling user value and earn the 'smart' designation. While challenging, this transformation offers unprecedented opportunities for differentiation and pricing power.

***Smart Tangibles*** provides a strategic framework for this evolution, showing how to integrate software, services, and ecosystems that extend customer relationships, drive recurring revenues, and build competitive moats. The book demonstrates how moving from transactional sales to sustained relationships transforms both business models and competitive dynamics.

Drawing on analytical frameworks and case studies from Apple, Tesla, Swatch, Nespresso, iRobot, and John Deere, the book bridges scholarship and practice across consumer and industrial markets. It equips practitioners and scholars with strategic logic, operational playbooks, and quantitative tools to navigate the convergence of hardware, software, and services – a transformation redefining industries from consumer goods to mobility and healthcare.

### About the Author

My name is **Yoel Frischoff**, a Tel Aviv-based product strategist and consultant, trained as an industrial designer. My career has moved from hands-on design and engineering, through technology management, entrepreneurship, and back to advisory work, giving me a front-row seat to how digital layers are reshaping what customers expect from physical products.

Working since 1991 across equipment, consumer goods, and other industries, I have participated in the profound shift that unfolded: physical products that once competed on function and price now faced growing pressure to become smarter, connected, and service-oriented.

As principal of **TheRoad**, a boutique practice focused on software-augmented hardware product strategy, I help manufacturers and industrial firms navigate this transition. My work centers on helping hardware companies transform traditional products into defensible, service-connected platforms that create recurring revenue and strengthen customer relationships.

Since 2022, I have been developing and refining the ideas behind ***Smart Tangibles*** through TheRoad blog, testing the frameworks with clients and combining field experience with research-driven insight.

What led me to write this book was the realization that many of today’s physical product failures are strategic, rather than technical. Companies lack a systematic way to think about physical products in a world where software reshapes how value is created, delivered, and expected.

The preliminary chapter of the first arc in this book (numbered, in the best computer nerd fashion, 0), I dwell on the role of product managers in the evolving domain of physical products gone smart.
