### Chapter 14 - The New MVP

### *Insert here SharkNinja case study and interview*

Throughout this book, I hope I made clear of the "one-shot" nature of physical product launches. The resources required are high enough to sink most ships. An established company may take the blow, but for startups for which the launch is of their first and only product, any failure could be one too many.

This is different to pure software products, which are by nature much more agile, and could pivot at a tolerable cost and over a reasonable timeframe.

This is all to demonstrate why early validation is key for physical products. Timely validation is so important for physical products, and by "timely" I mean: before unrecoverable resources and precious time are spent.

The questions for validation, though, remain the same:

-   Do users need your product?

    -   Does your product fulfill its functional promise?

    -   Is it safe?

    -   Reliable?  

-   Can users make use of your product?

    -   In all of its usage scenarios

    -   Does it require appropriate level of training (as in self explanatory for consumer goods)?

    -   Do you offer adequate support?  

-   Is your product perceived favorably by users?

    -   Can your users experience your unique value proposition?

    -   Is your USP in synch with your positioning?

The challenge with physical products is how to expose them so that validating signals are strong enough.
