Arc V exposed the risks that smart products create. This final part addresses the ultimate strategic question: how do you build a business model that captures the long-term value your smart product delivers?

Chapter 22 establishes the financial foundations — how blending goods and services economics changes pricing, margins, and profitability analysis. Chapter 23 examines the recurring revenue models that connectivity enables, from subscriptions to premium feature tiers, and how they deepen customer loyalty over time. Chapter 24 explores the endgame — "Product Valhalla" — where the service relationship evolves into something customers would never voluntarily leave. And Chapter 25 applies these frameworks to a concrete case: how iRobot might build a marketplace around its installed base, transforming a struggling hardware company into a platform business. Together, these chapters complete the journey from static product to defensible platform.
