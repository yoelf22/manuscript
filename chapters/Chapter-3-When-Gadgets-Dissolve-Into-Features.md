### **The Pattern: Mass Device Extinction**

Behold the iPhone moment – or the death knell – for digital point-and-shoot cameras and GPS navigation devices:

![gadget_decline_chart](../images/fig03-01-gadget-decline-chart.png)

*Figure 3.1 — Mass Extinction: Indexed Global Shipments of Digital Cameras and GPS Navigation Devices, 2000–2023*

The slogan '*There's an App for that*' did a great job in communicating the emergent understanding that the smartphone was in fact the only device we needed, virtually obliterating specialized devices we all used to carry, use, and buy: keyboard, pointing device, stylus, camera, compass, gps, wallet are needed no more, as they are all metaphorically folded into the metal and glass rectangular objects we call smartphones.

**Archaeological Findings: Point and Shoot Digital Cameras**

Look at the figure below. Chances are, many of the readers have never held or bought such a relic. Digital point‑and‑shoot cameras rose rapidly in the late 1990s and 2000s by making photography cheap, instant, and pocketable for the mass market, but they declined just as quickly once smartphones offered “good enough” cameras that people always carried anyway. In fact, shipments collapsed from 121 million digital cameras worldwide In 2010 to just 9 million—a 93% decline driven almost entirely by smartphone adoption.

Early models from brands like Kodak, Canon, and Sony popularized features such as LCD screens, autofocus, and compact zoom lenses, helping drive global digital camera sales to a peak of well over 100 million units per year around 2010–2011. 

As smartphone sensors, image processing, and social‑sharing apps improved (selfies and video calls are notable examples), the everyday snapshot migrated to phones, pushing dedicated compact camera shipments down by more than half within just a few years and forcing many manufacturers to scale back or exit the category.[[dpreview](https://www.dpreview.com/articles/7036163416/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-compact-camera)]

> Can smartphone photography match best-in-class cameras? Of course not. But a smartphone is almost always at hand, with no incremental cost beyond the device already carried. As Chase Jarvis famously observed, *“The best camera is the one that’s with you.”* For most casual photographers, this was enough. The smartphone did not need to be better - only good enough. The case was effectively closed, marking the beginning of the end for point-and-shoot cameras. Photography just became a feature, part of a **platform**.
>
> It is worth pausing to clarify what is meant by a *platform*. At its core, a platform is a product architecture built on a shared foundation that supports multiple functions or applications. Instead of creating separate, dedicated devices for each task, a platform consolidates diverse capabilities into a single, multipurpose system, allowing new functions to be added, extended, or recombined over time.

### **The Platform Paradigm: The Swiss Army Knife Model**

The proliferation of specialized tools and implements – in endless shapes, sizes, and price points – did not come without cost. Each and every craftsman has in their possessions congested tool chests, pegboards, and bottomless drawers of modern homes filled with countless utensils, each different in a minute way. Of course, this was never perceived as a problem in itself, rather as a boon for tool makers.

There are, however, situations that cannot sustain such a plethora of tools. The great outdoors – military and adventure alike – affords little storage space and weight. This was how the multitool – a category arguably heralded by the Swiss Army Knife – came into being: out of sheer necessity.

![Victorinox_Swiss_Army_Knife](../images/fig03-03-victorinox-swiss-army-knife.jpg)

*Figure 3.3 — Swiss Army Knife (Victorinox). Photograph by Ramessos (n.d.), [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Victorinox_Swiss_Army_Knife.jpg)*

The Swiss Army Knife compresses the utility of a host of hand tools into a single object, all sharing a common morphology: a <u>handle</u> with a <u>functional tip</u>. The ingenuity of the 1886 design lies in treating the handle as a **platform** – one shared chassis that multiple functional tips can pivot from and lock into place. The enabling breakthrough was a double-spring mechanism, which lets multiple implements – dozens of them in some models – fold neatly into the handle when not in use.

The benefits? A handy, portable, space saving, clutter–eliminating utility tool. 

The drawbacks? somewhat reduced functionality for each of these 'tips'. It is a balancing act for the designer.

### **The Smartphone Platform Architecture**

![Modern Software platform morphology](../images/fig03-05-modern-software-platform.png)

*Figure 3.5 — Smartphone platform morphology*

Fast forward 120 years, and Smartphones, as well as other software augmented products, share a similar platform approach. A base layer comprises of the physical inrastructures (Chassis, battery, electronics with all of their myriad functionalities), then an operating system layer avails the capabilities of each interactive component as software services, and finally – a host of 1st or 3rd party appclications accessing those services.

In fact, most hardware features sustain more than a single functionality. Consider the front camera in a smartphone. Initially it enables selphies – its original use – but other capabilities emerged, such as video calls, vlogging, and more. 

------

### **Economic Dynamics: Why Platforms Always Win**

#### Feature Economics

What are we talking about when we say 'feature' in the context of hardware product?

A good example is a passenger car: In many aspects, it is one of the most emblamatic platforms we all know. 

It consists of structural, mechanical, electric, and software features and subsystems that – combined in varying weights – form what we think of it as a sports car, a luxury saloon, an SUV or an off road truck:

![Subsystems of a passenger car](../images/fig03-06-subsystems-passenger-car.png)

*Figure 3.6 — Mind Map of Core Systems in a Petrol-Powered Passenger Car. Generated by the author*

Crucially, each such element is a hardware product in itself. Except for the chassis and bodywork, component manufacturing is usually delegated to sub-contractors. Each element is attached to the chassis (also known in auto-speak as 'platform'), and – whenever human interface related – operates through handles, paddles, levers, and buttons.

Every such component incurrs incremental variable costs in materials and labor. Head lamps, mirrors, tyres – All require additional material, manufacturing steps, and assembly. Add another novelty, and those costs recur for every unit produced.		

Software operates under a **fundamentally different** cost structure. Once a digital feature is developed, distributing an additional copy costs virtually nothing. The same holds when extending an existing digital platform: as long as no new hardware capabilities are required, the marginal cost of delivering that feature to one more user is effectively zero.

As a result, dedicated gadgets are structurally disadvantaged when compared to platform-based features. Physical products inevitably incur variable costs stemming from manufacturing, handling, and storage, while digital features are added at a marginal cost that is, for all practical purposes, zero.

Increasingly, modern vehicles mirror the digital platform model, in that more and more functionality migrates from the physical realm to the digital layers the car now affords. Tesla and other advanced manufacturers treat cars as 'smartphones on wheels' - software-defined platforms where new features arrive through downloads rather than hardware additions. Navigation, entertainment, and communication functions that once required separate devices are now absorbed into the car's central system, following the same zero-marginal-cost logic that made smartphones dominant.

#### Platform Prerequisites and Evolution

To become a platform, a smart tangible must meet some technical preconditions: It must boast the physical layer that would support the new capability: sensors, compute power, connectivity, sometimes cloud support - all these must be pre-installed or easily added-on. 

Once the infrastructure is there, however, additional functionality can be added post facto. GPS navigation, for instance, builds on GPS receiver, compass, screen, battery – these exist in any smartphone.

Consider the timeline of GPS evolution in smartphones to see how a deceptively simple addition of hardware feature boosts functionality (evolving over time). 

![GPS evolution in Smartphones](../images/fig03-07-gps-evolution-smartphones.png)
*Figure 3.7 — Timeline of smartphone GPS-based features with iPhone and Android launch markers.¹*

The AUD$3.6 (as [analysis showed](https://www.techpartner.news/news/apple-boosts-margin-on-iphones-115180)) inclusion of a GPS receiver, ushered in an era of Location Based Services, estimated roughly at 50–70B USD, of which Apple captures about 25–35% (≈12–25B USD/year), yielding around 10–15 USD of LBS‑linked value per active iPhone annually on an installed base of about 1.3–1.5B devices. 

Given that most iPhones are used for about 3–4 years before upgrade and can realistically generate revenue for 4–5 years in total use, this implies roughly 40–70 USD of LBS‑driven value per device over its lifetime, with a central estimate near 50–60 USD when assuming about four effective revenue years.

This goes to show that when a platform and a feature are aligned (as mobile phones and location based services are), so is the potential for synergies, and added value.

### **Resistance Factors: Why Some Devices Survive**

#### When Platform Absorption Fails

##### Flashlights

Since the early 2000's, virtually every feature or smart phone contains a LED based flashlight. One would have thought that would result in obliteration of flashlights, similar to the near extinction of point and shoot cameras.

![Flashlight_(Wuzur)](../images/fig03-08-flashlight-wuzur.jpg)

**Figure 3.8 — Handheld LED flashlight. (Wikimedia Commons, n.d.). Image retrieved from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flashlight_%28Wuzur%29.jpg**

The data, however, does not support this thesis in the case of flashlights: these continue to show solid growth in revenue and unit sales, seemingly unaffected by the mobile and smart phones onslaught.

![Unit Sales Comparison: LED Flashlights vs Mobile Phones (2000–2020)](../images/fig03-09-unit-sales-comparison-led.png)

*Figure 3.9 — Unit sales of LED flashlights and mobile phones (feature phones and smartphones), 2000–2020.*

The persistence of standalone flashlights is explained by a set of core performance dimensions that mobile phone platforms cannot practically internalize without undermining their primary function. 

- **Light intensity** in professional flashlights can be sustained at high output levels for extended periods without thermal throttling, exceeding the thermal and power constraints of phones. 
- **Optics** - including beam range, spread angle, and color rendering - rely on dedicated reflectors and lenses that require depth, alignment, and optical control incompatible with ultra-thin multipurpose devices. 
- **Battery life** remains a decisive factor, as flashlights are optimized for endurance, often using large or swappable cells to deliver hours or days of continuous operation, while phones must balance illumination against communication, computation, and connectivity. 
- **Form factor** matters: purpose-built housings enable directional control, gloved or mounted operation, impact resistance, and environmental sealing, all of which conflict with the ergonomic, aesthetic, and fragility constraints of smartphones. Together, these irreducible physical requirements explain why flashlights could be functionally encroached upon but not fully subsumed by mobile phone platforms.

The above figure compares estimated global unit sales of standalone LED flashlights with total mobile phone shipments from 2000 to 2020 to examine whether mobile phones integrated  functionality displaced dedicated flashlights. The comparison indicates that while mobile phones absorbed casual illumination use cases, standalone flashlights were not replaced in volume terms; instead, they persisted as lower-margin, commoditized products.

Although flashlights continue to sell in growing numbers, there is a steep decline in the aggregate market cap for flashlight makers. This however may be explained by the intensifying internal competition, caused by new entrants into this market, facilitated by the commodification of the white LED components and their assorted electronics.

![Flashlight Market: Declining Aggregate Value vs Rising Competition (2000–2020)](../images/fig03-10-flashlight-market-declining.png)

*Figure 3.10 — Aggregate market value of major flashlight manufacturers (blue, left axis) versus number of competing firms (orange, right axis), 2000–2020.*

##### Product attributes that cannot be subsumed by platforms

- Jobs to be done that cannot be virtualised
- Form factor, ergonomics, and environments where the platform is a bad fit
- Regulation, safety, and certification as real-world moats

---

##### Action Cameras

Another example, and remarkable exception to the decline of point and shoot cameras is the action camera category, led by GoPro Hero series.

![Cyclisme_&_GoPro_-_GoPro_Hero_4_(30)](../images/fig03-11-cyclisme-gopro-gopro-hero.jpg)

*Figure 3.11 — Action camera mounted for cycling use (GoPro Hero 4). Wikimedia Commons, n.d.). Image retrieved from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cyclisme_%26_GoPro_-GoPro_Hero_4%2830%29.JPG*

Action cameras' resistance to platform absorption is attributable to the specific features of these cameras:

- Peculiar optics with stabilized extra-wide, fixed focus, lenses
- Ruggedized enclosures, water and shock resistant
- Secured attachments to hardware, body harnesses, and head mounts
- Long battery life

These features could not be part of the smartphone platform, hence the resistance of the category.

### **Case Study: Platform Absorption in Practice**

#### CycleBe: The Bicycle Safety Beacon that never were

_Durable goods (AKA physical products) leaders must carefully evaluate competitive landscape, especially when existing software-based solutions exist. Software features, easy to implement and distribute at negligible cost, tend to render most standalone devices obsolete..._ A cautionary tale.

![seyda-unlu-Ci-aC2BTRHI-unsplash](../images/fig03-13-seyda-unlu-ci-ac2btrhi.jpg)

*Figure 3.13 — Road cyclists are always at risk*

In the competitive landscape of tech innovation, not every promising idea makes it to market success.

Today, I want to share the story of an ambitious bicycle safety hardware project that ultimately couldn't overcome the efficiency of mobile technology and the power of feature integration.

The journey offers valuable lessons for hardware entrepreneurs and product developers navigating similar challenges.

---

##### The Safety Problem and Initial Opportunity

Road safety for cyclists remains a critical concern worldwide. With increasing traffic and distracted driving, cyclists face significant risks daily.

A promising solution emerged when beacon software began facilitating communication between cyclists and drivers through navigation applications. By broadcasting a cyclist's location to nearby drivers' navigation systems, the technology created an invisible safety net, alerting drivers to be cautious around vulnerable road users.

Initially, Cyclebe developed a standalone mobile application.

However, the landscape shifted when major training software platforms like Strava incorporated the beacon functionality as a feature within their existing apps. Cyclists could now ride with an added layer of protection, all through the software they were already using for training and route tracking.

![Screenshot_strava_beacon](../images/fig03-14-screenshot-strava-beacon.png)

**Figure 3.14 — Strava's Beacon functionality screens, extracted from https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/224357527-Strava-Beacon**

##### The Hardware Alternative

Seeing how quickly beacon functionality was being absorbed into Strada's existing software platform, the team identified what it believed was a market opportunity: leaning on smartphone hardware limitations:

- Battery life
- GPS module accuracy

It then devised a product concept combining the beacon (GPS and cellular communicator) with an integrated backlight that would be mounted on the seatpost – creating a comprehensive safety solution within a single device.

The vision was compelling: a purpose-built safety beacon that wouldn't drain your phone battery, wouldn't require mounting your expensive smartphone to your handlebars, and would include critical visibility features.

![Beacon mounted on the seatpost, by Yama design](../images/fig03-15-beacon-mounted-seatpost-yama.png)

**Figure 3.15 — Beacon mounted on the seatpost, by Yama design**

##### Development Process

We approached development systematically, first determining the hardware architecture based on available modules. We needed reliable GPS positioning, energy-efficient cellular communication, and bright, long-lasting LED technology for the backlight feature.

Yama design, Our industrial-design partner, then created a beautiful, weather-resistant housing with a secure stem attachment system. The design prioritized aesthetics while ensuring the device would remain firmly attached during rides over any terrain.

The team produced concept renderings and physical mockups that garnered positive feedback from potential merchants, users and investors alike.

On the business side, we established comprehensive costing models covering NRE (Non Recurring Expenses), Unit economics built on the BOM (bill of materials) assembly, shipping and handling costs.

Production, testing, and logistics infrastructures were also considered, in a post industrial outsourcing model. The relatively small quantities forecasted dictated refrain in capital expenditure.

The numbers, however, did not look promising: Hardware products are hard to come by, and the unit costs for any conceivable quantity forecast reached or surpassed the unit cost of a mobile phone - translating into eye watering consumer price.

##### Why It Failed - Features Outcompete Products

Despite meticulous planning and genuine enthusiasm, the project ultimately failed to launch. The obstacles proved insurmountable for several key reasons:

**1\. Feature vs. Product Battle**

The most significant challenge was that we were attempting to create a standalone product to compete against what had already become a feature within the most popular mobile applications.

When functionality becomes integrated into existing platforms, creating a separate product specifically for that function faces steep adoption barriers.

Users were already getting beacon functionality through their training apps, making a dedicated device redundant. In this case, the feature outcompete the additional stand alone product.

It would have required a drastic performance boost to justify the additional costs of what came at no visible cost when offered as a software feature.

---

**2\. The Mobile Efficiency Factor**

Smartphones, as we demonstrated above, are the modern day Swiss utility knife - an incredibly efficient solution for many uses.

Already sporting GPS location and (obviousely) cellular communications capabilities, cyclists carry them anyway. Cyclebe's dedicated hardware couldn't compete with a strong enough user benefit that would justify the purchase price.

---

**3\. Duplicative Features**

The backlight feature, which was positioned as a key differentiator, also faced competitive pressures.

High-quality bicycle lights are widely available at relatively low price points, with options ranging from $15 to $50 for most riders' needs. This meant our integrated light solution wasn't providing enough unique value to justify the additional cost of a dedicated device.  

One of our strongest selling points was addressing the battery drain issues that plague smartphone-based solutions. However, the market had already solved this problem in a simpler way: portable battery packs. For around $20, cyclists could purchase compact external batteries that would keep their phones charged throughout even the longest rides, eliminating our key advantage at a fraction of our device's projected retail price.

---

##### Lessons Learned

This project's trajectory offers valuable insights for anyone considering hardware product development:

**1\. Beware the Feature Integration Trend**

When functionality becomes integrated into existing platforms as features rather than standalone products, the market often shifts permanently. Before developing dedicated hardware, honestly assess whether your target functionality has already been absorbed into existing ecosystems where users prefer consolidated solutions.

**2\. Value Proposition Must Exceed Alternatives**

For a hardware product to succeed against software alternatives, it must offer substantial advantages that cannot be easily replicated. Our beacon device offered incremental improvements but lacked truly transformative benefits that would justify its cost and the hassle of carrying another device.

**3\. Consider the Full Product Journey**

Hardware development requires navigating design challenges, engineering complexities, production ramp-up issues, and unpredictable supply chains. These hurdles demand a product with enduring value that can survive delays and challenges. Our beacon concept simply didn't have enough sustainable competitive advantage to justify this difficult journey.

---

##### Conclusion

While Cyclebe's bicycle safety beacon showed initial promise, it ultimately couldn't compete with the efficiency of mobile solutions and the rapid integration of beacon functionality into existing training platforms.

What began as a standalone opportunity had quickly become a standard feature, leaving little room for a dedicated device.

For entrepreneurs and product developers, the lesson is clear: when considering hardware solutions in today's market, ensure your value proposition can withstand both feature integration and the efficiency of multipurpose devices. Your hardware must solve problems in ways that are so superior or unique that users will gladly pay for and carry another device.

Sometimes the wisest decision in product development is recognizing when to pivot or abandon a concept, however elegant its design or noble its intentions. In this case, cyclists are ultimately better served by continued improvements to mobile beacon solutions rather than introducing another device to their already crowded handlebars.

### **Historical Context: The Traditional Gadget Economy**

As the Industrial Revolution progressed, the spreading ability to produce "the right tool tool for the job" increasingly became a commodity. Industrilization, initially started in heavy industries such as textiles, chemicals, metallurgy, and weaponry, soon extended to light manufacturing. This ushered in an era of mass production of everything from pocket watches and eyeglasses to kitchenware and sporting goods – each implement optimized for a specific function.

Nearly any need – or whim – could be met with a physical solution, developed and manufactured in factories springing up across the industrial belts on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as in emerging manufacturing hubs in the far east.

Many of these product categories evolved through intense competitive pressure, forcing continuous differentiation of the competitors. A major way of obtaining such differentiation came through single-purpose specialization: products honed to excel at a narrowly defined function, carving out defensible niches and affording their makers pricing power and sustained profitability.

**Add-On Digital Functionality as a Source of Vulnerability**: 

The advent of "smart" products – physical goods augmented with digital features – introduced a new dynamic. Digital features increasingly became the very differentiating capabilities – those consumers value most. Interestingly, however, digital features also became the easiest features to replicate, bundle, and absorbed into general-purpose platforms we already carry everywhere.

But why is this so?
