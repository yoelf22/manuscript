1. **Why is Hardware THAT hard?**  
   *The fundamental challenges product leaders face with integrated hardware and software products, the monolithic nature of hardware development, and why traditional software approaches fail in the physical realm*

2. **Hardware startup validation traps**  
   *Five critical validation challenges unique to hardware ventures, using cases like Better Place to illustrate how expensive hardware failures cascade and why early-stage testing must be approached differently*

4. **Evolving Competition**  
   *How globalization, cost arbitrage, and manufacturing democratization have fundamentally altered competitive dynamics, with case studies of iRobot's decline and Tesla's margin compression against Chinese competitors*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 5:**
*Is the Fiona effect a commonly understood concept in this field? The reference doesn't make sense to me. Isn't this more about a series of trade-offs that are made during the validation process? My understanding of Fiona's transformation was about not needing to align with classical standards of beauty - it wasn't a tradeoff made in pursuit of selling something.*

*Is imagination-maturity the usual language for this? Would imagination-realisation work better? I'd save maturity for a product that is many generations old e.g. a keyboard is a 'mature' product, but the first release of an all new product is not 'mature'*

*Again, I think you lose a lot of your audience when you claim that the car is the ultimate consumer product. Yawn. You can use the car show as an example if you think it is useful, but remove the language that assumes that this is something that a wide range of people care about: "drooling on fantasies" is really off-putting.*

*I think the trade offs you are discussing here will make more sense to the reader if they come after the economics chapters.*

---

## Arc II: Digital Transformation Foundations
*The technological infrastructure that transforms static hardware into smart, connected, and evolving products - from interfaces and connectivity to sensors and edge intelligence.*

5. **Digital interface: Changing the rules of the game, for hardware**  
   *How digital interfaces have revolutionized hardware products, from simple dials to sophisticated touchscreens, enabling software-defined interactions and over-the-air updates while creating new vulnerability and dependency challenges*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 3 (now Chapter 5):**
*I'm not sure that this chapter follows logically/structurally from the previous chapter. It's at a level of detail that is more granular than Chapter 3 or Chapter 5.*

*Ask yourself whether the reader has learned enough from you at this point to understand everything you have put in this chapter, and these examples.*

*What's the relationship between this chapter and Chapter 8? Would it make sense to put them closer together and maybe put this one first?*

6. **The Machine That Goes Ping**  
   *How to communicate complex product value through design signals, interface cues, and user experience elements that build trust and convey sophisticated capabilities in intuitive ways*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 14 (now Chapter 6):**
*Both good outlines of chapters that need to be turned into narratives. I think these can come later in the book because they are not part of your core message about validation.*

7. **The Connectivity Revolution** [*new chapter*]  
   *WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IoT protocols - the communication infrastructure that enables smart products to connect, share data, and integrate into ecosystems, from personal networks to Industry 4.0*

8. **FOTA: From Products to Living Systems** [*new chapter*]  
   *How over-the-air firmware updates transform static products into evolving platforms that improve over time, creating new competitive advantages while introducing novel risks*

9. **Beyond Human Perception: The Sensor-Powered Product** [*new chapter*]  
   *How environmental, biometric, and positioning sensors enable products to perceive, understand, and respond to their environment and users, creating context-aware functionality*

10. **Intelligence at the Edge: AI Meets Physical Products** [*new chapter*]  
    *Edge AI processing capabilities that enable real-time intelligence, enhanced privacy, and superior user experiences while reducing cloud dependencies and creating new competitive advantages*

---

## Arc III: Validation Cycles
*How smart product teams cut risk and capital waste by testing early, learning fast, and sequencing investment deliberately – applying lean principles to the slower, higher-stakes realities of physical production.*

11. **Taming Concepts**  
    *Moving from concept to validated product requirements while managing the tension between imagination and practical constraints, avoiding the "Fiona effect" where early concepts diverge too far from achievable products*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 7 (now Chapter 11):**
<!--Rename from "Validated Ideatio" to "Taming The Concept"-->
<!--Change the 'Fiona effect' with either-->
<!--a. The "Runway to Retail" effect-->
<!--Haute couture fashion vs the version you can actually buy in a store-->
<!--or-->
<!--b. The "Blueprint to Building" effect-->
<!--Architect concept rendering vs actual building-->

*See comments above about Musk & Tesla. I think you're going to lose more than just me as a reader with this example.*

*I think you need to highlight more about trust when you talk about connected services, and that you can lose a lot of customers at once if you breach trust or privacy; also note that the EU is making more noise about regulating this business model. For example, what if there is anti-trust action that forces you to allow other providers to deliver services to your hardware?*

12. **Beyond MockUps: The Art and Science of Hardware Validation**  
    *Advanced validation strategies for hardware ventures, including staged investment approaches, risk mitigation techniques, and decision frameworks for pivoting or persisting through development challenges*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 10:**
*[No specific feedback provided for this chapter in original]*

13. **The New MVP**  
    *Strategies for de-risking hardware development through early validation techniques adapted for physical products, including prototyping approaches and user testing methodologies that account for manufacturing constraints*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 6 (now Chapter 13):**
*[No specific feedback provided for this chapter in original]*

14. **Lean hardware**  
    *Adapting lean startup principles to hardware development, including MVP strategies for physical products, iterative design approaches, and managing the longer feedback loops inherent in hardware*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 8 (now Chapter 14):**
*I get the sense that 'Market Need and Positioning' are relevant much earlier in the process, and should come earlier in the narrative.*

*Also here I am getting really tired of reading about cars.*

---

## Arc IV: Positioning, Perceptions
*How narrative framing, launch strategy, and perceived value shape the way customers understand and adopt smart products – elevating features into meaning, transforming interfaces into trust signals, and turning differentiation into lasting advantage through positioning, storytelling, and brand experience.*

15. **First Impressions**  
    *The critical importance of initial user experience in hardware products, design psychology, and how physical product interactions shape lasting brand perceptions and adoption decisions*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 11 (now Chapter 15):**
*I would put this chapter earlier in the narrative because I think it has useful prompts for getting people who are thinking about how to engineer a thing to think about how people will use the thing.*

16. **Killer Features**  
    *Identifying and developing breakthrough capabilities that define product categories, with analysis of what makes certain features transformative versus incremental, and the strategic timing of feature introduction*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 12 (now Chapter 16):**
*For me, this got a bit too far from the brief. Most new products are not killers and that's fine… isn't it enough to make people's lives better and make a good return on a product? It's interesting storytelling but I presume that a lot of people who are interested in these stories already know them, so you have to focus again on your relationship with the reader:*

*- Why do they have to hear about this from you?*
*- What is distinct about your interpretation of these events, and how are you using that to convey your message in your book?*
*- Maybe another way to say that is, why would someone who has invented a killer feature, or has the capacity to do so, need to read this book? It seems like one thing they all had in common was that they came from companies that had money to burn on R&D and experience with bringing those things to market - is that the background that your readers will have?*

*This is a duplication of a case study you've already used - you need to decide where and how you want to use it.*

17. **Can Swatch Outsmart its Nokia Moment?**  
    *Strategic reinvention lessons from Swatch's transformation of the watch industry, applied to how established hardware companies can adapt to digital disruption and changing consumer expectations*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 13 (now Chapter 17):**
*Both good outlines of chapters that need to be turned into narratives. I think these can come later in the book because they are not part of your core message about validation.*

*I think the Swatch example is a good example for how thinking about a change in concept can rejuvenate a product, and should come earlier in the narrative. I think this example is much more useful than the car examples for getting your readers to understand the hardware and service dimensions of a product, and you want them thinking about this as early as possible. So I would have this and iRobot in the first 3 chapters. It also makes the book useful for people who are working with older hardware - it might give them ideas for how to market it differently, and again I think that is something that will engage more readers than cars.*

## Arc V: Paradise Lost
*The unintended consequences of smart product adoption: how convenience becomes surveillance, features become dependencies, and innovation creates new forms of inequality. This arc examines the security, privacy, and social challenges that emerge when products become platforms, and explores approaches for building smart tangibles that enhance human agency rather than diminishing it.*

18. **Smart AND Secured? Think Again**  
    *The security challenges inherent in connected hardware products, balancing convenience with protection, and design strategies that build user trust while maintaining functional sophistication*

### **Previous Feedback on Cybersecurity Chapters:**
*I'd move the chapters on cyber security to after these chapters on economics, so you have a bit of teaching in the middle and then a change of pace with the cyber attack stories to liven things up again.*

19. **Smart Product Cyber: Threat Mitigation**  
    *Practical cybersecurity approaches for smart hardware, threat modeling for connected devices, and building security considerations into product development from concept through deployment*

20. **Digital Divides and Social Impact** [*new chapter*]  
    *How smart products create new forms of inequality through cost barriers, digital literacy requirements, and accessibility challenges, plus strategies for inclusive design and equitable technology deployment*

---

## Arc VI: Business Models and Moats
*How recurring revenue models, data-driven services, and platform economics transform smart products from one-time sales into enduring competitive systems – creating loyalty, defensibility, and sustained economic advantage through subscription models, marketplace strategies, and customer lifetime value optimization.*

21. **Business Model Essentials**  
    *Revenue model evolution from one-time sales to recurring services, subscription strategies for hardware companies, and creating sustainable value streams through digital service layers*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 18 (now Chapter 21):**
*Again you are re-using material - this time, the bin.*

*The Nespresso example I think should be in chapter 1 or 2 because the subscription concept is something you want the reader to be thinking about as early in the narrative as possible.*

*The John Deere thing - I think you need to use examples that are closer to home and that you understand more closely. The thing with agricultural equipment is that if it breaks during seeding or harvesting, daily losses accrue at an alarming rate, so it has distinctive servicing requirements - it needs infinite technicians during the on season and zero during the off season. If you get details wrong on something like this you can lose credibility with the reader, so I think it's better to either stick to products where you have first-hand experience, or put in a disclaimer that you are describing something you don't have first-hand experience of, but understand to be something that works in that market.*

*In this chapter I think you are downplaying privacy concerns and also relying very heavily on examples from big players: is this where the audience for your book is working? I'd be much more interested to know how small businesses are navigating this market and innovating in this space.*

22. **From Recurring Revenue to Customer Loyalty and Beyond**  
    *Building lasting customer relationships through service models, loyalty programs, and continuous value delivery that transcends the initial product purchase*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 19 (now Chapter 22):**
*When you tell a story about something you have directly observed or experienced, it is really interesting! It's so much more compelling for the reader than charts about Apple's market share.*

23. **Product Valhalla**  
    *How smart products transform from one-time transactions into ongoing relationships through service layers, creating customer value and competitive moats beyond the initial hardware sale*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 9 (now Chapter 23):**
*This is an interesting chapter. However, again I think the reader would benefit from hearing about examples on a smaller scale and closer to your experience. I don't imagine that many first-time product creators are going to do Apple-scale launches, so some grassroots examples would help to ground this chapter - the Sony Walkman example in the next chapter is a good one, because it was on a more local scale and is hence more relevant to your audience.*

*What's missing here is some stories about successful and less successful product launches that you have direct experience of.*

24. **Reviving iRobot: Build a Marketplace**  
    *Strategic turnaround analysis: how struggling hardware companies can reinvent themselves through platform thinking, ecosystem development, and marketplace business models*

### **Previous Feedback on Chapter 20 (now Chapter 24):**
*[No specific feedback provided for this chapter in original]*

## **General Feedback Not Tied to Specific Chapters:**

### **Overall Structure and Voice:**
*Overall, and as a general comment about where you are up to at the moment, I think you would benefit from mapping out how you are going to take the reader from A to B, the lessons you want them to learn on the way, and the best order to present the lessons. I've made suggestions about which material I think should come earlier in the book.*

*As a structuring exercise, I think you should think about this book as a conversation with the reader, and write down your chapter headings along with a reason why you think each chapter should come in the sequence that it comes. Think about what concepts your reader is picking up along the way, and what examples you want to use. Then check that they will arrive at each example already knowing most of the concepts they'll need to know to understand the example.*

### **Car Examples and Tesla Concerns:**
*General comment about the prevalence of car-based examples*
*The car examples are not working for me, for several reasons. One is a change to the transport mix - people who have access to things like Lyft and car sharing, and live in dense cities are less likely to want to own a car, and while older readers might be fans of private vehicle ownership, younger readers might not be.*

*The other thing is that Tesla is a polarising brand, and nearly everyone has an opinion about Tesla. It doesn't matter if their opinion is an informed opinion or not - but what you are doing with your Tesla examples is asking the reader to turn off what is in their own head about Tesla, and to listen to you.*

*In addition, I think you risk damaging your credibility with the reader if you expect them to ignore the Elon Musk of it all. You might be able to separate his hardware achievements from his political opinions and actions, but I think many readers would struggle with that. I don't think the book falls over if you choose to highlight products other than Tesla, when you have the option.*

### **Economics Chapters:**
*The economics chapters are useful. My suggestion would be to put them somewhere in the middle of the book, close to the chapters on validation which rely heavily on cost terminology.*

### **Reader Experience:**
*Reader check in: at this point in the book I'm feeling a bit blah blah Apple, blah blah big tech firms. I think that if your readers are coming from one of these firms, they are already around experienced teams that can teach them this stuff. What are you offering for your readers who are not working in big firms, or are early career graduates, or not in tech at all? I think you need MUCH more personal and achievable examples that come from your own life.*

*This is feeling more like a textbook written by MegaCorp than a friendly instruction manual written for people wanting to find their feet in the industry.*

### **AI Chapter Placement:**
*To stop this chapter from looking like something you added at the end because everyone was talking about AI, think about whether the examples from this chapter would work well alongside other material and might be placed more in the middle of the book - or at least not right at the end.*

*My suggestion for a last chapter - from among the chapters I have seen so far - would be your museum lean hardware example.*

### **Final Summary:**
*To summarise:*
*There are too many cars and not enough Yoel in this book.*
*I believe that there is a lot you can teach me/a reader, but I don't feel like you're in conversation with your audience. The stories and examples you are using are ones that anyone could use, so it feels like a business school lecture, not a one-to-one story time with an industry expert. The rare occasions where the reader gets a glimpse of how YOU think are much more authentic than what Steve Jobs did on stage.*

*This doesn't mean that you should switch to informal language or use inside jokes - the formal tone is appropriate, but the examples are too far from your own and most readers' experience to be compelling.*
