Arc I established why traditional hardware strategies increasingly fail. This part examines the different technological paradigm enabling today's winning companies to pull away from old world incumbents, building new and durable advantage.

At the device level, this paradigm consists of six interlocking layers: digital interfaces that make hardware programmable; power and energy systems that determine which capabilities are physically reachable; connectivity that links products to networks and ecosystems; firmware systems that enable continuous improvement after sale; sensors and actuators that allow devices to perceive and act on their environment; and edge intelligence that processes data locally in real time. Together, these capabilities transform a product from a static object into a living system - one that learns, adapts, and improves.

This part of *Smart Tangibles* examines each layer in turn. The goal is not to catalog technologies for their own sake, but to understand what each enables strategically: how interfaces shift value from hardware to software; how the power budget constrains every subsequent architectural decision; how connectivity creates ecosystem lock-in; how over-the-air updates reshape the customer relationship; how sensors and actuators unlock new functionality; and how edge AI changes the economics of intelligence. These are the building blocks that determine whether a hardware company competes on price or on something far more durable.
