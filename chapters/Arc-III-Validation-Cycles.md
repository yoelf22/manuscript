Arc II laid out the infrastructure layers that transform static hardware into smart, connected products. But infrastructure alone does not reduce the fundamental risk of building the wrong thing. Physical products carry capital exposure that software does not — tooling, inventory, certification, and supply chain commitments that are difficult or impossible to reverse once made.

This part examines how smart product teams sequence their investment to cut that risk: validating concepts before committing to prototypes, prototyping before committing to tooling, and testing with users before committing to production. The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty — that is impossible in hardware — but to ensure that each dollar spent buys the maximum possible learning before the next dollar is committed.
