Preface  
Here you are using a different voice to the rest of the book i.e. ‘This book does x.’ This isn’t how you address the reader in the rest of the text, so already you are making the reader work to understand what exactly they are getting into. 

It doesn’t tell the reader why they should read the book. It’s a statement about what the book contains but it’s not giving the reader a reason to read it, unless they already know what they don’t know. You need to get the reader interested by convincing them that they can learn something from you.

I think it would be better to start with ‘this is a sequence of mistakes that I see people make, and I have written this book so that you can do better, and be more successful. 

You also need to convince the reader why you are the best person to tell them how to do it better e.g. in my years in the industry I have seen people make these mistakes, observed this evolution, and learned these lessons. You need to make the case for why someone in this field should read your book and not some other book.

In summary, you need to do a few things here: 

- Convince the reader that there is something for them to learn \- motivate the reader   
    
- Convince the reader that you are the person to teach them \- establish trust and confidence in you as the teacher.

Overall, and as a general comment about where you are up to at the moment, I think you would benefit from mapping out how you are going to take the reader from A to B, the lessons you want them to learn on the way, and the best order to present the lessons. I’ve made suggestions about which material I think should come earlier in the book. 

As a structuring exercise, I think you should think about this book as a conversation with the reader, and write down your chapter headings along with a reason why you think each chapter should come in the sequence that it comes. Think about what concepts your reader is picking up along the way, and what examples you want to use. Then check that they will arrive at each example already knowing most of the concepts they’ll need to know to understand the example. 

Alternative Chapter 1  
The first chapter is when you need to establish credibility with the reader. I think the best way to do this is to tell a story that is uniquely yours, about a product you know well and know better than most other people do. 

You can write the example in a way that creates the structure for the rest of the book e.g. why hardware is hard, what the testing process looks like, where the costs occur etc. You can use contrasting examples of a product that succeeded and a product that failed. That’s a good way to give the reader an idea of the breadth of your experience. 

You have to show that you are an expert, not someone who is commentating from the sidelines. If you pretend to know too much about something where a lot of your audience knows, or thinks they know, more than you, then you fail the first test of making them believe in you.

You can also make yourself more relatable and come across as a thoughtful person if you show in the first chapter, how you learned/changed your mind/refined your thinking in the course of working on a product. You need to show how you acquired your expertise, and persuade people that they can learn from it. 

From there you can transition into the current first chapter, about why hardware is hard. 

Chapter 1  
For various reasons, I’m not sure what the car example is doing here \- but it seems like there is a lot still to be written in this chapter \- “… Cut to the basic challenges of creating physical products (cars included), then scaling them up, generating profit in the process. These have not changed. Building hardware products is an extremely hard endeavor.”

As I said above, in this section you are still getting the reader to trust you, so stick closely to what you know and products you are familiar with here. 

The section on costs, profit margins, comparison of software and hardware etc is sound. 

The negative framing of the Provisional Conclusion is damaging to the relationship you are trying to develop with the reader. Make it positive and optimistic. If you don’t believe that hardware is worth doing, you’re probably not the best person to write this book. 

Chapter 2  
Here again your voice is different. From ‘this book’ in the prologue to ‘Let us discuss’ here. 

If you can anchor this information to a solid example, such as the one I recommend for your Chapter 1, here you can start to reinforce your message with reference to your introductory, relationship-establishing story.

For example, you could say ‘remembering the example from chapter one, the challenges for a hardware venture fit into five categories’. Then you can link each category to a scenario that the reader is already familiar with. This helps the reader to link the concepts to a real life example, and exposes them again to your experience and credibility. 

In the Ford Edsel example, it’s not clear why the product failed so it leaves the reader dangling in terms of what they are meant to learn. If it was a random outcome then just say so \- it doesn’t undermine your point that failure is expensive. At the moment the explanation is hinted at in the Better Place paragraph but not fully delivered. 

Interim conclusion (2)  
Again, this negative framing is damaging to the relationship you are trying to build with the reader. 

Chapter 3  
Digital interface  
This is an interesting history lesson and it finally demonstrates the scope of your experience with this topic, so in that sense it is good. 

My recommendation here is to remember to talk about digital exclusion \- these innovations are fine for digital natives but alienating for people who came late to touchscreen-based and web-enabled technology, AND the massive privacy, security and geopolitical vulnerabilities of products that are tied to the manufacturer for the lifetime of the product. 

I think you have two chapter 4s? Something isn’t clear here. 

Chapter 4a \- Product Managers in the Hardware industry  
I’m not sure that this chapter follows logically/structurally from the previous chapter. It’s at a level of detail that is more granular than Chapter 3 or Chapter 5\. 

Ask yourself whether the reader has learned enough from you at this point to understand everything you have put in this chapter, and these examples. 

General comment about the prevalence of car-based examples  
The car examples are not working for me, for several reasons. One is a change to the transport mix \- people who have access to things like Lyft and car sharing, and live in dense cities are less likely to want to own a car, and while older readers might be fans of private vehicle ownership, younger readers might not be. 

The other thing is that Tesla is a polarising brand, and nearly everyone has an opinion about Tesla. It doesn’t matter if their opinion is an informed opinion or not \- but what you are doing with your Tesla examples is asking the reader to turn off what is in their own head about Tesla, and to listen to you. In our conversation, I tried saying something to you about Tesla and I got as far as ‘Tesla is a big company’ before you started disagreeing with me and interrupted to say that it is not a big company by car standards. Tesla’s size is irrelevant to where I was going with my comment \- my point, which you exactly illustrated, is that if you want the reader to listen to you talk about something, you have to choose things that they won’t already have a strong opinion about. If you can’t turn off your opinions about Tesla for long enough for me to express my opinion, how can you expect the reader to do the same, especially when you don’t have direct experience of Tesla? This is another reason why I encourage you to use examples that are in your direct area of expertise, and where it’s much less likely that the reader will know (or think they know) more than you. 

In addition, I think you risk damaging your credibility with the reader if you expect them to ignore the Elon Musk of it all. You might be able to separate his hardware achievements from his political opinions and actions, but I think many readers would struggle with that. I don’t think the book falls over if you choose to highlight products other than Tesla, when you have the option. 

Chapter 4b \- Physical Products: Early Validation is Key  
Or is this still Chapter 4?  
I think you need examples to illustrate this \- it sounds like a business book full of dot points that the reader nods their way through without linking what they are reading to real life examples. 

Cyclebe example

- I am completely lost re: the claim that Strava does what Cyclebe was trying to do. Strava is a social site that you post activities to after you have done them \- it doesn't have any sort of live tracking function.   
- I still don’t understand what this thing was meant to do. Were drivers meant to actively scan for cyclists up ahead? How was this useful if it was only used by vehicles using positional data? 

Chapter 5  
Is the Fiona effect a commonly understood concept in this field? The reference doesn’t make sense to me. Isn’t this more about a series of trade-offs that are made during the validation process? My understanding of Fiona’s transformation was about not needing to align with classical standards of beauty \- it wasn’t a tradeoff made in pursuit of selling something. 

Is imagination-maturity the usual language for this? Would imagination-realisation work better? I’d save maturity for a product that is many generations old e.g. a keyboard is a ‘mature’ product, but the first release of an all new product is not ‘mature’ (maybe mature relative to the first drawing of it, but not mature in terms of its lifecycle). 

Again, I think you lose a lot of your audience when you claim that the car is the ultimate consumer product. Yawn. You can use the car show as an example if you think it is useful, but remove the language that assumes that this is something that a wide range of people care about: “drooling on fantasies” is really off-putting.

I think the trade offs you are discussing here will make more sense to the reader if they come after the economics chapters.

Chapter 6  
As I already said, this is interesting but it seems to be about an application of hardware more than the development of new hardware, so I’d be inclined to move it to later in the book. 

Chapter 7  
See comments above about Musk & Tesla. I think you’re going to lose more than just me as a reader with this example. 

I think you need to highlight more about trust when you talk about connected services, and that you can lose a lot of customers at once if you breach trust or privacy; also note that the EU is making more noise about regulating this business model. For example, what if there is anti-trust action that forces you to allow other providers to deliver services to your hardware?

Chapter 8  
What’s the relationship between this chapter and Chapter 4? Would it make sense to put them closer together and maybe put this one first? 

I get the sense that ‘Market Need and Positioning’ are relevant much earlier in the process, and should come earlier in the narrative. 

Also here I am getting really tired of reading about cars. 

Chapter 9  
This is an interesting chapter. However, again I think the reader would benefit from hearing about examples on a smaller scale and closer to your experience. I don’t imagine that many first-time product creators are going to do Apple-scale launches, so some grassroots examples would help to ground this chapter \- the Sony Walkman example in the next chapter is a good one, because it was on a more local scale and is hence more relevant to your audience. 

What’s missing here is some stories about successful and less successful product launches that you have direct experience of. 

Chapter 10  
For me, this got a bit too far from the brief. Most new products are not killers and that’s fine… isn’t it enough to make people’s lives better and make a good return on a product? It’s interesting storytelling but I presume that a lot of people who are interested in these stories already know them, so you have to focus again on your relationship with the reader: 

- Why do they have to hear about this from you?  
- What is distinct about your interpretation of these events, and how are you using that to convey your message in your book?  
- Maybe another way to say that is, why would someone who has invented a killer feature, or has the capacity to do so, need to read this book? It seems like one thing they all had in common was that they came from companies that had money to burn on R\&D and experience with bringing those things to market \- is that the background that your readers will have?

Chapter 11  
I would put this chapter earlier in the narrative because I think it has useful prompts for getting people who are thinking about how to engineer a thing to think about how people will use the thing. 

Chapter 12  
This is a duplication of a case study you’ve already used \- you need to decide where and how you want to use it. 

Chapter 13 & 14  
Both good outlines of chapters that need to be turned into narratives. I think these can come later in the book because they are not part of your core message about validation. 

Chapter ?  
The economics chapters are useful. My suggestion would be to put them somewhere in the middle of the book, close to the chapters on validation which rely heavily on cost terminology. 

I’d move the chapters on cyber security to after these chapters on economics, so you have a bit of teaching in the middle and then a change of pace with the cyber attack stories to liven things up again. 

Chapter 17   
Again you are re-using material \- this time, the bin. 

The Nespresso example I think should be in chapter 1 or 2 because the subscription concept is something you want the reader to be thinking about as early in the narrative as possible. 

The John Deere thing \- I think you need to use examples that are closer to home and that you understand more closely. The thing with agricultural equipment is that if it breaks during seeding or harvesting, daily losses accrue at an alarming rate, so it has distinctive servicing requirements \- it needs infinite technicians during the on season and zero during the off season. If you get details wrong on something like this you can lose credibility with the reader, so I think it’s better to either stick to products where you have first-hand experience, or put in a disclaimer that you are describing something you don’t have first-hand experience of, but understand to be something that works in that market. There’s a lot more to say about the John Deere business model \- not just what was in the video I sent to you. 

In this chapter I think you are downplaying privacy concerns and also relying very heavily on examples from big players: is this where the audience for your book is working? I’d be much more interested to know how small businesses are navigating this market and innovating in this space. 

Reader check in: at this point in the book I’m feeling a bit blah blah Apple, blah blah big tech firms. I think that if your readers are coming from one of these firms, they are already around experienced teams that can teach them this stuff. What are you offering for your readers who are not working in big firms, or are early career graduates, or not in tech at all? I think you need MUCH more personal and achievable examples that come from your own life.

This is feeling more like a textbook written by MegaCorp than a friendly instruction manual written for people wanting to find their feet in the industry.

Chapter 18  
I think the Swatch example is a good example for how thinking about a change in concept can rejuvenate a product, and should come earlier in the narrative. I think this example is much more useful than the car examples for getting your readers to understand the hardware and service dimensions of a product, and you want them thinking about this as early as possible. So I would have this and iRobot in the first 3 chapters. It also makes the book useful for people who are working with older hardware \- it might give them ideas for how to market it differently, and again I think that is something that will engage more readers than cars. 

Chapter 19  
When you tell a story about something you have directly observed or experienced, it is really interesting\! It’s so much more compelling for the reader than charts about Apple’s market share.

To stop this chapter from looking like something you added at the end because everyone was talking about AI, think about whether the examples from this chapter would work well alongside other material and might be placed more in the middle of the book \- or at least not right at the end. 

My suggestion for a last chapter \- from among the chapters I have seen so far \- would be your museum lean hardware example.

To summarise:   
There are too many cars and not enough Yoel in this book.   
I believe that there is a lot you can teach me/a reader, but I don’t feel like you’re in conversation with your audience. The stories and examples you are using are ones that anyone could use, so it feels like a business school lecture, not a one-to-one story time with an industry expert. The rare occasions where the reader gets a glimpse of how YOU think are much more authentic than what Steve Jobs did on stage. 

This doesn’t mean that you should switch to informal language or use inside jokes \- the formal tone is appropriate, but the examples are too far from your own and most readers’ experience to be compelling.
